# App Store Review Notes - verifd iOS

## App Description

verifd is a privacy-first call verification service that helps users identify legitimate callers. By using out-of-band verification (SMS/web link), callers can prove their identity before placing a call. Once verified, they receive a temporary "vPass" that allows their next call to ring through like a known contact.

## Key Features

### 1. Call Directory Extension (IdentityLookup)
- **Purpose**: Filter verification-related SMS messages to a dedicated folder
- **Privacy**: All filtering happens on-device; no message content leaves the device
- **Behavior**: ALLOW-only filtering - never blocks normal SMS messages
- **User Control**: Can be disabled in Settings > Messages > Unknown & Spam

### 2. App Shortcuts (Siri & Spotlight)
- **Purpose**: Quick actions for granting vPasses to recent callers
- **Available Actions**:
  - Grant 30-minute pass to last missed call
  - Set expecting window (15/30 minutes)
  - Block last caller
- **Privacy**: All shortcuts operate locally using cached call data
- **Feature Flag**: Controlled via remote configuration for gradual rollout

### 3. Time-Sensitive Notifications
- **When Used**: Only during user-initiated "expecting" windows
- **Duration**: Maximum 30 minutes per window
- **Purpose**: Alert user when verification window is active
- **User Control**: Can be disabled in Settings > Notifications > verifd

### 4. Temporary Contacts (30-day vPass)
- **Implementation**: Creates temporary contact cards for 30-day passes
- **Cleanup**: Background task removes expired contacts daily
- **Privacy**: No permanent modifications to user's contact list
- **Fallback**: If background task fails, Call Directory denies expired passes

## Privacy & Data Handling

### Data Collection
- **Minimal**: Only phone numbers and verification timestamps
- **No PII**: Names and reasons are stored encrypted, deleted after expiry
- **Telemetry**: Differential privacy with Laplace noise (Îµ=0.1)
- **No Tracking**: No device IDs, no user profiles, no location tracking

### Data Storage
- **Local**: Recent calls cached for 24 hours
- **Server**: vPasses stored with automatic expiry
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Deletion**: Automatic cleanup of expired data

### Permissions Used
- **Contacts**: For temporary contact creation (30-day passes only)
- **Notifications**: For time-sensitive alerts during expecting windows
- **Siri & Shortcuts**: For quick actions via voice/Spotlight

## Feature Flags & Remote Configuration

All new features are deployed behind feature flags for safety:

```json
{
  "APP_SHORTCUTS_ENABLED": false,  // Default OFF
  "IDENTITY_LOOKUP_ENABLED": false, // Default OFF
  "enableRiskScoring": false        // Always starts OFF
}
```

Features are gradually enabled based on:
- Geographic location (country-level only)
- App version compatibility
- Cohort percentage rollout
- User opt-in for certain features

## App Review Response

If asked about specific features:

**Q: Why do you need the IdentityLookup extension?**
A: To filter verification-related SMS messages into a dedicated folder, making it easier for users to find verification links. This is ALLOW-only filtering - we never block normal messages.

**Q: Why do you create temporary contacts?**
A: Only for 30-day vPasses, to ensure reliable call identification. These are automatically cleaned up and never permanently modify the user's contacts.

**Q: Why do you use Time-Sensitive notifications?**
A: Only during user-initiated "expecting" windows (max 30 minutes) when the user explicitly wants to receive calls. Never used for marketing or unsolicited notifications.

**Q: How do you handle user privacy?**
A: We collect minimal data (phone numbers only), use differential privacy for telemetry, auto-delete expired data, and never track users across apps or websites.
