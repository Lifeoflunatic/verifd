### RCA Stub Template

```markdown
# Canary Rollback RCA - 2025-01-17

## Executive Summary
Automated rollback triggered after 2 consecutive days of gate failures at canary_20 phase.

## Timeline
- **2025-01-11**: Canary started at 5%
- **2025-01-16**: Promoted to 20% after 5 successful days
- **2025-01-17 02:00 UTC**: Day 1 gates failed
- **2025-01-18 02:00 UTC**: Day 2 gates failed
- **2025-01-18 02:01 UTC**: Automatic rollback to 5%

## Impact
- **Duration**: 2 days at 20% coverage
- **Affected Users**: ~250,000 (20% of US traffic)
- **Metrics Impact**:
  - Verify Lift dropped 33% (25.3% ‚Üí 16.8%)
  - False Allow increased 233% (0.45% ‚Üí 1.5%)
  - Complaint Rate increased 367% (0.09% ‚Üí 0.42%)

## Failed Gates
| Gate | Day 6 | Day 7 | Threshold | Status |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Verify Lift | 18.2% | 16.8% | ‚â•20% | ‚ùå FAIL |
| Notif Tap | 10.5% | 9.8% | ‚â•12% | ‚ùå FAIL |
| False Allow | 1.2% | 1.5% | ‚â§0.8% | ‚ùå FAIL |
| Complaint Rate | 0.35% | 0.42% | ‚â§0.2% | ‚ùå FAIL |

## Root Cause
_[To be determined through investigation]_

### Hypothesis 1: Scale Effect
- Performance degradation at 20% load
- Database connection pooling issues
- Rate limiting too aggressive

### Hypothesis 2: Regional Issues
- US-CENTRAL region introduced at 20%
- Possible carrier-specific issues
- Network latency differences

### Hypothesis 3: Feature Interaction
- Risk scoring in shadow mode causing delays
- Template system conflicts
- Cache invalidation problems

## Investigation Actions
- [ ] Review performance metrics during failure window
- [ ] Analyze error logs for anomalies
- [ ] Check database query performance
- [ ] Review US-CENTRAL specific metrics
- [ ] Examine user complaint details

## Immediate Actions Taken
1. ‚úÖ Automatic rollback to 5% coverage
2. ‚úÖ Incident channel created
3. ‚úÖ On-call engineer paged
4. ‚úÖ Metrics dashboard frozen for analysis
5. ‚úÖ User cohorts reverted to 5% seed

## Remediation Steps
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Test fix in staging
- [ ] Create targeted test plan
- [ ] Schedule careful re-promotion

## Lessons Learned
_[To be completed after investigation]_

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Root cause analysis | @oncall | 2025-01-18 | In Progress |
| Fix implementation | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| Staging validation | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| Re-promotion plan | @platform-lead | TBD | Pending |
