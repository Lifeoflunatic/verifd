# Vanity Verify Links + Success Banner Implementation

## 🎯 Requirements Implemented

- [x] `/verify/start` returns short vanity path (`/v/<token>`) that redirects to web-verify form with `t=<token>`
- [x] Web success page shows "vPass granted (scope, expires) — try calling me now."
- [x] Added minimal rate-limit on `/verify/start` to prevent link farming
- [x] cURL flows work: `/verify/start` → web submit → `/pass/check` shows vPass active

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Vanity URL System
- **Short URLs**: `/v/abc12345` (8-character tokens)
- **Automatic expiry**: Links expire with their verification tokens (15 minutes)
- **Memory-based storage**: In-memory mapping with automatic cleanup
- **302 redirects**: Vanity URLs redirect to web-verify with full token

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **IP-based limiting**: 10 requests per hour per IP address
- **Prevents link farming**: Stops abuse of vanity URL generation
- **Hour-based windows**: Limits reset every hour

### 3. Enhanced Success Page
- **Dynamic messaging**: Different content for granted vs pending vPasses
- **Clear call-to-action**: "Try calling me now" when vPass granted
- **Visual indicators**: Celebration emojis and status banners
- **Scope display**: Shows pass duration (30m/24h/30d)
- **Expiration times**: Clear expiry timestamps

### 4. Dual-Mode Web Form
- **New requests**: Standard verification request flow
- **Token mode**: When accessed via vanity URL, shows approval form
- **Context-aware UI**: Different titles and buttons based on mode

## 📁 Files Modified

### Backend (`apps/backend/src/`)
- `routes/verify.ts`: Added vanity URL generation and rate limiting
- `routes/index.ts`: Added `/v/:vanityToken` redirect handler

### Frontend (`apps/web-verify/app/`)
- `page.tsx`: Added token parameter handling and dual-mode logic
- `success/page.tsx`: Enhanced with vPass granted messaging

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Changes

#### POST /verify/start
**Before:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "abc123...",
  "verifyUrl": "http://localhost:3001/verify/abc123...",
  "expiresIn": 900
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "abc123...",
  "verifyUrl": "/v/xyz789",
  "expiresIn": 900
}
```

#### GET /v/:vanityToken
- **New endpoint**: Redirects to web-verify with full token
- **302 redirect**: `Location: http://localhost:3001?t=<fullToken>`
- **Error handling**: 404 for missing/expired tokens

### Web Form Behavior

#### Standard Mode (no token)
1. User fills form with their details
2. Submits to `/verify/start`
3. Gets vanity URL to share
4. Success page shows "request sent"

#### Token Mode (from vanity URL)
1. Form shows "approve or deny" context
2. User enters their phone number
3. Submits to `/verify/submit` with `grantPass: true`
4. Success page shows "vPass granted - try calling now!"

### Success Page Messages

#### vPass Granted Flow
```
🎉 vPass Granted!
Great! John Doe now has temporary access to call you. Try calling me now.

✨ vPass Active — Try Calling Now!
Scope: Medium-term (24 hours)
Expires: 8/11/2025, 5:16:52 AM
🎉 Your call will now ring through like a contact!
```

#### Request Sent Flow
```
📤 Verification Request Sent
Thanks, John Doe! Your verification request has been sent.

Share this link: /v/abc12345
Send this link to the person you want to call for approval.
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

All test scenarios pass:

### 1. Vanity URL Generation ✅
```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3000/verify/start \
  -d '{"phoneNumber":"+1234567890","name":"Test","reason":"Testing"}'
# Returns: {"verifyUrl": "/v/abc12345"}
```

### 2. Vanity URL Redirect ✅
```bash
curl -L localhost:3000/v/abc12345
# Redirects to: localhost:3001?t=fullToken123...
```

### 3. Rate Limiting ✅
```bash
# 11th request from same IP returns 429
curl -X POST localhost:3000/verify/start ... # 429 Too Many Requests
```

### 4. Complete Flow ✅
1. `POST /verify/start` → vanity URL
2. `GET /v/token` → redirect with full token
3. Web form submit → vPass granted
4. `GET /pass/check` → `{"allowed": true}`

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Long, cryptic verification URLs
- Generic success messaging
- No clear call-to-action when vPass granted

### After
- Clean, shareable vanity URLs (`/v/abc123`)
- Celebratory success messages with clear CTAs
- Context-aware UI that guides users through next steps

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

### Rate Limiting
- Prevents vanity URL farming attacks
- IP-based tracking with hourly windows
- Configurable limits via environment variables

### Token Management
- Short vanity tokens (8 chars) for sharing
- Long verification tokens (32 chars) for security
- Automatic cleanup of expired mappings
- Memory-efficient storage

### Error Handling
- Graceful 404s for missing vanity links
- Clear error messages for rate limiting
- Proper HTTP status codes throughout

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The implementation is complete and tested with:
- ✅ All requirements met
- ✅ DoD criteria satisfied
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Rate limiting protection
- ✅ User-friendly messaging
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code

**Next steps**: Deploy and monitor vanity URL usage patterns to optimize token length and expiry times.
