Follow Kotlin best practices. Never break min SDK/Play policies. Produce small, testable PRs.

MCP priority for tasks:
1) context7 (Android/Jetpack APIs) → 2) serena (impact set) → 3) filesystem (edits) → 4) ide (gradle/build) → 5) memory (decisions)
Never call tavily unless platform docs are missing or policy is unclear.
