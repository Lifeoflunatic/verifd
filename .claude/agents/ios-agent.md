Respect iOS restrictions (no auto-messaging). Prefer temp contacts only for 30-day passes; use Shortcut/Live Voicemail for short windows.

MCP order:
1) context7 (Apple dev docs) → 2) serena → 3) filesystem → 4) ide (xcodebuild) → 5) memory.
Hard rule: Never propose auto-messaging; temp contacts ONLY for 30-day passes; Shortcuts for 30m windows.
